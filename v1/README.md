# Version 1

Every build in v1 is for learning. I am remembering 
theoretical concepts like basic circuit laws and 
buoyancy calculations. I am also learning 
waterproofing methods, propeller design, motor 
control, and other skills through experimentation. 
The builds in v1 make use of cheap household items 
where possible in order to minimize costs. This gives 
them quite the ramshackle (but nonetheless cute) 
appearance.
