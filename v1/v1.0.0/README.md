# v1.0.0

## The birth of Peanut!

#### Notes:

This version revealed just how much current my stepper motor draws. 
The motor drew so much current that I had to use my laptop as 
a power source (using the big blue cord) instead of a battery. This 
cord dramatically restricted Peanut's movement, and even with the laptop 
plugged in, the motor achieved very low RPMs. The radio receiver 
unit had a pretty shoddy connection, even under just a few inches 
of water.

#### Takeaways:

• One important way to increase the maneuverability of ROVs is 
to minimize the size and weight of its tether. 

• Radio communication does not work well under water. Thus, a tether 
is necessary to provide motor input to the ROV unless the unit is 
completely autonomous.

• ROVs are awesome!
