# Peanut the ROV

Peanut is a submersible ROV (remotely operated vehicle).
Its body was first made out of a plastic peanut canister, 
hence the name! I started making Peanut as a fun side
project after I got fascinated by the manufacturing 
and programming of underwater ROVs. You can look inside the 
folders for the different versions to see how 
Peanut has progressed so far.

This project began on September 2nd, 2022. Peanut will 
receive many future updates, so stay tuned.
