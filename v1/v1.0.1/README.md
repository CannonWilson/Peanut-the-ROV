# v1.0.1

## Peanut gains some weight

#### Notes:

I added copper pellets to weigh down Peanut, making it close to
neutrally buoyant. I also replaced the laptop connection used in 
v1.0.0 with a 9V battery. When Peanut was submerged under the water while
the motor ran, Peanut moved in slow circles instead of moving forward. 
Finally, when I took Peanut out of the water, I noticed that 
some water had entered the main cavity in between the screw-on lid 
and the main pice of plastic. Luckily all of my parts still worked!

#### Takeaways:

• I need to learn more about Propeller design. With a poorly designed propeller, 
the ROV might not move in the correct direction.

• I need to look for a different motor to move Peanut. The current one
draws too much power and generates too few RPMs.

• Waterproofing is key. I will need to look at different containers for 
Peanut's body, and it would be worthwhile to explore better waterproofing 
techniques besides duct tape and hot glue.
